# QR Data Manager (QRDM)
QRDM provides a python package, network API endpoints, and web interfaces for encoding
and decoding documents as a series of QR codes.

## Setup and Execution

The `qrdm` package is written in pure Python; the ease of installation is dependent on
availability of its dependencies.

The simplest method of installing the `qrdm` package is via `pip`.
```sh
pip install qrdm
```

If `pip` is able to reach a suitable package index, `qrdm` will install along with its
core Python dependencies.

**IMPORTANT**
> The QR decoding functionality depends on the [`pyzbar`][pyzbar] python package, which
> in turn depends on the `zbar` shared library. This may require you to install the
> `zbar` package via your system's package manager.
> See the [`pyzbar` installation instructions][pyzbar-install] for more details.

Two main "package extras" are available for `qrdm` that provide REST API application
("backend") and Web application ("frontend") services for the QR encoding & decoding
functions. These can be included by specifying `qrdm[backend]` or
`qrdm[frontend]` to the installation command above, respectively.

### Web UI via Streamlit
A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) "frontend" can be run via:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mit-ll/qrdm
cd qrdm
python -m pip install .[frontend]
streamlit run ui/QRDM_Home.py --client.toolbarMode=viewer
```

This will host the app at `http://localhost:8501` by default, with pages for QR encoding
and decoding. The host and port can be controlled by passing `--server.port=XXXX` and
`--server.address=X.X.X.X`, as per the syntax of the `streamlit run` command.

### REST API via FastAPI

To run the "backend" FastAPI app via uvicorn, use `uvicorn` directly. For example:
```sh
python -m pip install qrdm[backend]
uvicorn qrdm.backend:app --host localhost --port 8182
```

This will result in the app being hosted at `http://localhost:8182`. Swagger
documentation will be hosted at `http://localhost:8182/docs`, if an internet connection
is available.  Further options are available via `uvicorn` command-line configuration.
